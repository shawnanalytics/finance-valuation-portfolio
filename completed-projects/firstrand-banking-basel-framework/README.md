# FirstRand Limited — Banking & Regulatory Capital Framework

## Overview
This project develops an integrated banking performance, capital sustainability, and intrinsic valuation framework for FirstRand Limited.  

The analysis combines historical financial statement modeling with forward-looking valuation under Basel III regulatory constraints to assess sustainable profitability and market-implied expectations.

---

## Analytical Objectives
- Evaluate sustainable Return on Equity (ROE) across credit cycles.
- Assess capital resilience relative to Basel III CET1 requirements.
- Determine intrinsic value using Residual Income and Dividend Discount Models.
- Reverse engineer market-implied ROE embedded in current valuation multiples.
- Stress test profitability and capital buffers under adverse scenarios.

## Methodology

### Phase 1 — Historical Performance Analysis (FY2021–FY2025)
- Net Interest Income (NII) trend analysis  
- Net Interest Margin (NIM) dynamics  
- Credit Loss Ratio (CLR) normalization assessment  
- DuPont ROE decomposition  
- Capital ratio analysis (CET1, RWA)

### Phase 2 — Capital & Valuation Framework
- Sustainable ROE estimation  
- Residual Income valuation model  
- Dividend Discount Model (DDM)  
- Market-implied profitability reverse engineering  
- Multi-scenario stress testing (Base / Mild Stress / Severe Stress)

---

## Key Findings
FirstRand demonstrates structurally high-teen sustainable ROE supported by resilient capital buffers and a deposit-led funding model.  

However, current market pricing implies elevated profitability expectations relative to normalized credit conditions, suggesting valuation sensitivity to ROE compression and credit cycle shifts.
