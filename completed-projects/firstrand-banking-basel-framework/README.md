# FirstRand Limited — Banking & Regulatory Capital Framework

## Overview
This project develops a structured banking valuation and capital sustainability framework for FirstRand Limited, integrating historical performance analysis with forward-looking intrinsic valuation under Basel III regulatory constraints.

The objective is to assess sustainable ROE, capital adequacy durability, and valuation expectations embedded in current market pricing.

---

## Objective
- Evaluate sustainable Return on Equity (ROE) across credit cycles.
- Assess capital resilience under Basel III CET1 requirements.
- Determine intrinsic value using Residual Income and Dividend Discount Models.
- Reverse engineer market-implied profitability expectations.

---

## Methodology

### Phase 1: Historical Performance (FY2021–FY2025)
- Net Interest Income (NII) analysis
- Net Interest Margin (NIM) trend assessment
- Credit Loss Ratio (CLR) evaluation
- DuPont ROE decomposition
- Capital ratio analysis (CET1, RWA)

### Phase 2: Valuation & Capital Sustainability
- Residual income valuation framework
- Dividend Discount Model (DDM)
- Sustainable ROE estimation
- Market-implied ROE reverse engineering
- Stress testing under capital and credit cycle scenarios

---

## Key Insight
FirstRand demonstrates high-teens sustainable ROE supported by resilient capital buffers. However, current market pricing reflects elevated profitability expectations relative to normalized credit conditions, indicating valuation sensitivity to credit cycle dynamics.
