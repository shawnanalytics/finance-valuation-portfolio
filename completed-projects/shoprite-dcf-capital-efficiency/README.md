# Shoprite Holdings — DCF & Capital Efficiency Framework

## Overview
This project develops a structured intrinsic valuation framework for Shoprite Holdings, integrating historical financial analysis with forward-looking discounted cash flow modeling and capital efficiency assessment.

The objective is to evaluate sustainable value creation, margin durability, and valuation sensitivity under multiple operating scenarios.

---

## Objective
- Assess intrinsic equity value using a five-year forecast DCF framework.
- Evaluate capital allocation discipline through ROIC vs WACC comparison.
- Analyse earnings quality, cash flow conversion, and margin sustainability.
- Quantify valuation sensitivity under Bear, Base, and Bull assumptions.

---

## Methodology

### Phase 1: Historical Analysis (FY2023–FY2025)
- Income statement trend analysis
- Margin stability assessment
- Cash flow quality evaluation
- Liquidity and leverage review

### Phase 2: Forecast & Valuation (FY2026–FY2030)
- Revenue forecast driven by scenario-based growth assumptions
- Operating cash flow derived from scenario-specific margin inputs
- Capital expenditure modeled as % of revenue
- Free Cash Flow calculation
- Terminal value derived via Gordon Growth Model
- Enterprise value bridged to implied equity value per share

---

## Key Assumptions (Base Case)

- WACC: 12%
- Terminal Growth: 3.0%
- Operating Cash Flow Margin: 5.5%
- Capex as % of Revenue: 3.0%

Full scenario variations available within the model workbook.

## Key Insight
Shoprite demonstrates sustained ROIC above WACC, supporting long-term value creation. However, valuation outcomes remain highly sensitive to margin durability and terminal growth assumptions. Under modeled scenarios, implied intrinsic value remains below prevailing market pricing, suggesting limited margin of safety.
