# Naspers Limited — Holding Company NAV & Structural Discount Framework

## Overview
This project develops a structured Net Asset Value (NAV) framework to evaluate intrinsic value and persistent discount dynamics within a complex holding company structure.

The analysis focuses on look-through asset valuation, FX translation mechanics, and the structural discount-to-NAV phenomenon that characterizes investment holding companies.

---

## Analytical Objectives
- Construct a look-through NAV valuation model.
- Assess structural discount persistence and re-rating potential.
- Model FX translation effects (HKD/ZAR, USD/ZAR).
- Evaluate capital allocation impact on intrinsic value.
- Quantify sensitivity of implied share price to discount compression.

---

## Methodology

### Asset-Level Valuation
- Tencent look-through ownership valuation.
- Market value translation across currencies.
- Corporate net debt integration.
- Equity bridge to implied NAV per share.

### Discount Dynamics
- Historical discount-to-NAV analysis.
- Scenario-based discount modeling (Bull / Base / Bear).
- Discount sensitivity grid & convexity visualization.
- Implied share price modeling under re-rating scenarios.

---

## Key Insight
Naspers valuation is primarily driven by structural discount dynamics rather than operating performance. Even modest discount compression materially impacts implied intrinsic value, highlighting convexity in re-rating scenarios.
